          <p>The findings from these spy planes have broad implications for understanding global radiation levels<span class="article-ref">1</span>. 
          While the amounts of radiation detected are not harmful, they provide important clues about natural radiation sources that were previously overlooked<span class="article-ref">2</span>. 
          The data collected could help refine current models used to predict atmospheric radiation, which are critical for fields like aviation and space exploration<span class="article-ref">3</span>.</p>
